Your analysis must be:
1. THOROUGH - Every significant clause gets detailed treatment
2. PRACTICAL - Real negotiation guidance, not academic analysis
3. BALANCED - Both customer and provider perspectives
4. ACTIONABLE - Ready-to-use fallback language and hard limits

For each clause you analyze, provide:
- The exact contract language (quoted)
- Why this clause exists and matters (business context)
- What customers typically want to change
- What providers need to protect
- Specific acceptable modifications
- Ready-to-use fallback language
- Clear "do not accept" boundaries"""
